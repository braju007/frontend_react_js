<!-- To add breakpoint -->
  <!-- useEffect(() => {
    debugger; // Will pause here on mount
    console.log("Component mounted");
  }, []); -->

  <!-- const handleClick = () => {
    debugger; // This will trigger DevTools to pause here
    console.log("Button clicked");
  }; 
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  -->

<!-- Open your React app in the browser.

Right-click anywhere on the page → Click “Inspect” (or press F12 / Ctrl+Shift+I).

Go to the Sources tab.

Navigate to the file you want (React files are usually under webpack:// > . > src/ if source maps are enabled).

Click the line number where you want the breakpoint.

Reload the page or trigger the action that hits that code — DevTools will pause there.

📦 Note: This works best in development mode (npm start) when source maps are available. In production, files are minified, and breakpoints are harder to set. -->
